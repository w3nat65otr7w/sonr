| Decentralized Web Node (DWN)                | A decentralized, distributed, and secure network of nodes that store and share data. It is a decentralized alternative to traditional web hosting services.                           |
| Decentralized Identifier (DID)              | A unique identifier that is created, owned, and controlled by the user. It is used to establish a secure and verifiable digital identity.                                             |
| HTMX (Hypertext Markup Language eXtensions) | A set of extensions to HTML that allow for the creation of interactive web pages. It is used to enhance the user experience and provide additional functionality to web applications. |
| IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)           | A decentralized, peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data. It is a distributed file system that allows for the creation and sharing of content across a network of nodes.    |
| WebAuthn (Web Authentication)               | A set of APIs that allow websites to request user authentication using biometric or non-biometric factors.                                                                            |
| WebAssembly (Web Assembly)                  | A binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.                                                                                                                        |
| Verifiable Credential (VC)                  | A digital statement that can be cryptographically verified.                                                                                                                           |
