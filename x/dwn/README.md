# `x/dwn`

The `x/dwn` module is the foundational engine of the Sonr ecosystem. It provides a comprehensive **Decentralized Web Node (DWN)** implementation that serves as the backbone for user-controlled data storage, protocol management, and secure vault operations. The module enables users to maintain sovereign control over their data while participating in a decentralized ecosystem.

## Overview

The DWN module implements the [Decentralized Web Node specification](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/), providing:

- **Personal Data Stores**: User-controlled storage for structured data records
- **Protocol-Based Interactions**: Define and enforce data schemas and interaction patterns
- **Granular Permissions**: Fine-grained access control using capability-based authorization
- **Secure Vaults**: Enclave-based key management and transaction signing via WebAssembly
- **Multi-Chain Transaction Building**: Support for both Cosmos SDK and EVM transaction construction
- **Enhanced Address Derivation**: BIP44 HD wallet address derivation for multiple blockchain networks

## Module Structure

## Core Concepts

### Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs)

A DWN is a personal data store that enables individuals to manage their data independently of centralized providers. Each user's DWN serves as their agent in the decentralized web, storing data, managing permissions, and executing protocols on their behalf.

### Records

Records are the fundamental unit of data storage in a DWN. Each record can:

- Store arbitrary data with optional encryption
- Be organized hierarchically using parent-child relationships
- Conform to specific protocols and schemas
- Be published for public access or kept private

### Protocols

Protocols define structured ways for applications to interact with DWN data. They specify:

- Data schemas for validation
- Permission models
- Interaction patterns between different parties

### Permissions

The DWN uses a capability-based permission system where:

- Permissions are granted as signed tokens (JWTs)
- Access can be scoped to specific interfaces, methods, protocols, or records
- Permissions can be delegated and revoked

### Vaults

Vaults provide secure, enclave-based key management enabling:

- Hardware-backed key generation and storage
- Secure transaction signing without exposing private keys
- Multi-party computation capabilities
- WebAssembly-based secure execution environment
- Multi-chain transaction building for Cosmos SDK and EVM networks
- BIP44 HD wallet address derivation with configurable coin types

#### VaultKeeper Implementation

The VaultKeeper provides a comprehensive interface for managing cryptographic vaults within the DWN module. It implements the following core functionality:

- **Vault Creation**: Creates new vaults with enclave-based key generation using WebAssembly plugins
- **State Management**: Manages vault states including ownership, public keys, and enclave data
- **Secure Operations**: Provides signing and transaction broadcasting capabilities through secure enclaves
- **Refresh Mechanisms**: Handles vault state refresh with configurable intervals for security
- **Verification**: Cryptographic signature verification for vault operations
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Transaction building for both Cosmos SDK and EVM networks using pkg/txns
- **Address Derivation**: BIP44 HD wallet address derivation for multiple blockchain networks

The VaultKeeper integrates with the Motor plugin system (`motr.wasm`) to provide isolated, secure execution environments for cryptographic operations.

##### VaultKeeper Interface Methods

The VaultKeeper interface provides the following methods for vault management:

**Core Operations:**

- `CreateVault(ctx, msg)`: Creates a new vault with enclave-based key generation
- `RefreshVault(ctx, msg)`: Refreshes the enclave state with configurable intervals
- `SignWithVault(ctx, msg)`: Signs messages using the vault's secure enclave
- `BroadcastTx(ctx, msg)`: Broadcasts transactions through the vault's enclave
- `VerifySignature(ctx, publicKey, message, signature)`: Verifies cryptographic signatures

**Query Operations:**

- `GetVaultState(ctx, vaultID)`: Retrieves vault state by ID
- `ListVaultsByOwner(ctx, owner)`: Lists all vaults owned by a specific address

**Actor System Integration:**

- `SpawnVault(opts...)`: Creates vault actors with configuration options
- `SpawnSimpleVault()`: Creates vaults without database persistence (testing)
- `SpawnSimpleVaultNamed(name)`: Creates named vaults for testing scenarios

All methods return appropriate response types and handle error conditions including ownership verification, parameter validation, and enclave communication failures.

**Transaction Building and Address Derivation:**

The VaultKeeper integrates with the `pkg/txns` package to provide enhanced multi-chain transaction capabilities:

- `BuildCosmosTransaction(params)`: Builds unsigned Cosmos SDK transactions with proper fee estimation
- `BuildEVMTransaction(params)`: Builds unsigned Ethereum/EVM transactions with gas estimation
- `CreateVaultSigner(vaultID)`: Creates MPC-based signers for secure transaction signing
- `EstimateTransactionFee(txType, params)`: Estimates transaction fees for both Cosmos and EVM networks
- `DeriveWalletAddresses(did, salt)`: Derives both Cosmos and EVM addresses using BIP44 HD wallet derivation

**Address Derivation Features:**

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Generates addresses for both Cosmos SDK (Bech32) and EVM (0x) formats
- **Deterministic Derivation**: Uses DID and salt for reproducible address generation
- **Configurable Coin Types**: Supports different coin types for various blockchain networks
- **BIP44 Compliance**: Follows BIP44 hierarchical deterministic wallet standard
- **Secure Generation**: Address derivation uses cryptographically secure methods

## Events

The DWN module emits comprehensive typed events for all state-changing operations. These events provide a detailed audit trail and enable efficient tracking of DWN-related activities.

### Event Types

### Event Indexing and Querying

Events can be queried and filtered using CometBFT WebSocket or standard blockchain explorers. Example queries:

```bash
# Query all record write events
tm.event='Tx' AND dwn.v1.EventRecordWritten.record_id EXISTS

# Query events by target DID
dwn.v1.EventRecordWritten.target='did:sonr:example'

# Query protocol configuration events
tm.event='Tx' AND dwn.v1.EventProtocolConfigured.published=true
```

### Best Practices for Event Consumers

1. **Indexing**: Configure comprehensive CometBFT event indexing
2. **Performance**: Use efficient, targeted event queries
3. **Replay Handling**: Implement robust event replay mechanisms
4. **Error Resilience**: Handle missing or out-of-order events gracefully

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: All write operations require proper authorization (JWT/signature)
2. **Encryption**: Sensitive data should be encrypted before storage
3. **Vault Security**:
   - Vaults use WebAssembly enclaves for tamper-resistant key protection
   - Private keys never leave the secure enclave environment
   - VaultKeeper enforces ownership verification for all operations
   - Refresh intervals prevent stale enclave states
4. **Permission Scoping**: Grant minimal required permissions
5. **Revocation**: Regularly review and revoke unused permissions
6. **VaultKeeper Security**:
   - Enclave attestation ensures execution environment integrity
   - Key generation uses cryptographically secure random sources
   - Signature operations are isolated within the enclave
   - Vault states are immutably stored in blockchain state
