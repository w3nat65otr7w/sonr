---

## Overview

Sonr is a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain focused on decentralized identity and asset management. This guide provides comprehensive information for validators interested in securing the Sonr network and participating in its specialized identity infrastructure ecosystem.

<Note>
  Sonr is currently in testnet/development phase. While there's no confirmed
  mainnet launch date, early participation in testnet operations is highly
  recommended for prospective validators.
</Note>

## Network Positioning

Sonr differentiates itself within the Cosmos ecosystem through:

- **Decentralized Identity Focus**: Implementing W3C DID standards and WebAuthn integration
- **Highway Architecture**: Specialized node infrastructure for identity services
- **Fast Wallet Generation**: 600ms wallet creation with IPFS storage capabilities
- **Developer Tools**: React SDKs and identity-focused APIs

## Hardware Requirements

Professional validator operations require substantial infrastructure investment to ensure network security and reliability.

## Network Parameters

### Validator Network Structure

For a 50-validator network with 1 billion token supply:

#### Early Network Phase (30% staking ratio)

- **Inflation**: 15% (bootstrap incentives)
- **Validator Participation**: Commission-based earnings structure
- **Delegator Rewards**: High early participation incentives

#### Bootstrap Phase (50% staking ratio)

- **Inflation**: 12% (balanced growth)
- **Validator Participation**: Balanced commission structure
- **Delegator Rewards**: Sustainable growth incentives

#### Mature Network (67% staking ratio)

- **Inflation**: 7% (long-term stability)
- **Validator Participation**: Stable commission structure
- **Delegator Rewards**: Long-term participation incentives

### Recommended Parameters

- **Minimum validator stake**: 1,000,000 SNR (0.1% of supply)
- **Optimal self-bond**: 2,000,000 SNR (0.2% of supply)
- **Commission range**: 5-15% (5% mandatory minimum)
- **Inflation range**: 5-18% with 8% target at 65% staking
- **Unbonding period**: 21 days standard

## Operational Considerations

### Infrastructure Requirements

Validators should ensure adequate infrastructure to support reliable network participation.

### Reward Sources

- **Block Rewards**: Inflation-based token issuance for network security
- **Transaction Fees**: Gas fees and proposer bonuses from network activity
- **Additional Rewards**: ICS rewards, cross-chain fees, and ecosystem participation

## Security Architecture

### Sentry Node Design

Implement a multi-layered security approach:

```
Internet → Sentry Nodes (3-5) → Private Network → Validator Node
```

### Critical Security Implementations

  <Card title="Key Management">
    - Hardware Security Modules (HSM) - Tendermint Key Management System (TMKMS)
    - Remote signing capabilities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Network Security">
    - Geographic distribution across datacenters - Automated double-sign
    prevention - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
  </Card>
  <Card title="Operational Security">
    - 99.9%+ uptime requirements - Encrypted backups across locations - Strict
    access controls and audits
  </Card>

### Key Types

1. **Consensus Key**: Hot key for block signing (ed25519)
2. **Operator Key**: Cold storage for validator transactions (secp256k1)
3. **Node Key**: P2P network identification

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Testnet Participation (Months 1-3)

<Note type="warning">
  Begin with testnet operations to gain experience without operational risk.
</Note>

- Hardware procurement and datacenter setup
- Team training on Cosmos SDK operations
- Security procedure development
- Community engagement and reputation building

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Preparation (Month 4)

- Deploy production hardware in Tier 3+ datacenters
- Implement sentry node architecture across regions
- Configure monitoring and alerting systems
- Establish 24/7 operational procedures

### Phase 3: Mainnet Genesis (Month 5+)

- Participate in genesis ceremony
- Self-bond required SNR tokens (1-2M recommended)
- Configure optimal commission rates (start at 5-7%)
- Launch validator with foundation delegation support

### Phase 4: Operational Excellence (Ongoing)

- Maintain 99.9%+ uptime through redundant systems
- Actively participate in governance proposals
- Provide regular updates to delegators
- Contribute to ecosystem development

## Foundation Support Programs

### Delegation Program

Sonr implements a foundation delegation program allocating 10-15% of total supply:

- **Coverage**: 30-35 validators (60-70% of active set)
- **Requirements**: 3-month testnet participation
- **Terms**: 6-12 month delegation periods
- **Renewal**: Performance-based criteria
- **Focus**: Geographic distribution and community contributions

### Testnet Incentives

- **Monthly Rewards**: Testnet participation incentives for active validators
- **Mainnet Slots**: Top performers receive guaranteed mainnet positions
- **Foundation Delegations**: 6-month delegations of 2M tokens for top testnet validators

## Monitoring and Operations

### Prometheus Metrics

- System metrics (CPU, RAM, disk, network)
- Tendermint consensus metrics (height, voting power, peer count)
- Custom application metrics (missed blocks, proposal statistics)

### Critical Alerts

- Low peer count (less than 5 peers)
- High block time intervals
- Resource utilization warnings
- Disk space projections

### Grafana Dashboards

- Real-time performance monitoring
- Historical trend analysis
- Multi-validator comparison views

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

- **Double-signing prevention**: Proper key management and TMKMS
- **State corruption recovery**: Automated backup systems
- **Network partitions**: Geographic distribution strategies
- **Upgrade failures**: Staging environment testing

### Operational Risks

- **Network participation**: Maintain consistent validator performance
- **Delegation concentration**: Limits on single delegator exposure
- **Commission optimization**: Community-competitive rates
- **Infrastructure management**: Efficient operational procedures

## Future Opportunities

As Sonr matures, validators can explore additional network services:

- **Relayer Operations**: IBC connection services
- **RPC Endpoints**: Developer infrastructure services
- **Archive Nodes**: Historical data provision
- **Identity Services**: Custom solutions leveraging Sonr infrastructure
- **Interchain Security**: Consumer chain participation
