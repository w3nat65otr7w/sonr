## Overview

The SNR token distribution is designed to balance immediate network needs with long-term sustainability, ensuring fair allocation across stakeholders while maintaining sufficient reserves for ecosystem growth.

**Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 SNR**

<Note>
  Token distribution follows a carefully planned vesting schedule to prevent
  market manipulation and ensure aligned incentives across all participants.
</Note>

## Supply Dynamics

### Circulating Supply Factors

The circulating token supply depends on several key factors:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Initial Circulation">
    200M SNR at genesis (20% of total supply)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Minted Tokens">
    New tokens created through inflation for rewards and subsidies
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vesting Releases">
    Scheduled releases from locked allocations over time
  </Card>
  <Card title="Staked Tokens">
    Tokens locked in staking reducing effective circulation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Token Velocity

Token velocity measures how frequently tokens change hands and directly impacts token value:

```math
\text{Token Value} = \frac{\text{Economic Activity}}{\text{Circulating Supply} \times \text{Velocity}}
```

## Allocation Strategy

### Core Allocations

The token distribution prioritizes long-term network health through strategic allocations:

1. **Community & Ecosystem** (35% - 350M SNR)
   - Airdrop Program: 100M SNR (10%)
   - Testnet Incentives: 50M SNR (5%)
   - Staking Rewards Pool: 100M SNR (10%)
   - Ecosystem Grants: 100M SNR (10%)

2. **Team & Advisors** (20% - 200M SNR)
   - Team Allocation: 150M SNR (15%)
   - Advisors: 50M SNR (5%)

3. **Investors** (25% - 250M SNR)
   - Seed Round: 75M SNR (7.5%)
   - Series A: 100M SNR (10%)
   - Strategic Round: 75M SNR (7.5%)

4. **Foundation Treasury** (15% - 150M SNR)
   - Operations: 75M SNR (7.5%)
   - Reserve Fund: 75M SNR (7.5%)

5. **Validator Incentives** (5% - 50M SNR)
   - Genesis Validators: 30M SNR (3%)
   - Delegation Program: 20M SNR (2%)

### Vesting Schedules

<Warning>
  All non-circulating allocations follow strict vesting schedules to ensure
  gradual market entry and prevent supply shocks.
</Warning>

#### Team Vesting

- **Team**: 12-month cliff, 48-month linear vest
- **Advisors**: 6-month cliff, 24-month linear vest
- No transfers until cliff periods expire

#### Investor Vesting

- **Seed Round**: 6-month cliff, 36-month linear vest
- **Series A**: 3-month cliff, 24-month linear vest
- **Strategic Round**: 25% immediate, remainder over 18 months

#### Community Vesting

- **Airdrop**: 25% immediate, 75% over 12 months
- **Testnet**: Distribution over 6-month testnet period
- **Ecosystem Grants**: Project milestone-based releases

#### Foundation Vesting

- **Operations**: 10% at genesis, 90% over 5 years
- **Reserve Fund**: Minimum 3 years lockup, governance approval required

## Inflation Mechanism

### Reward Distribution

The network implements controlled inflation to incentivize participation:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Validator Rewards">
    Block rewards for consensus participation distributed pro-rata to stake
  </Card>
  <Card title="Highway Services">
    Compensation for off-chain computation, storage, and routing services
  </Card>
  <Card title="Governance Rewards">
    Incentives for proposal creation and voting participation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Inflation Schedule

**Year 1**: 15% inflation (aggressive growth)
- Focus on network bootstrapping
- High rewards for early adopters

**Year 2**: 12% inflation (continued expansion)
- Stabilization period begins
- Balanced growth incentives

**Year 3**: 9% inflation (stabilization)
- Network maturation
- Sustainable reward levels

**Year 4+**: 7% inflation (long-term sustainability)
- Minimal dilution
- Self-sustaining economics

## Economic Safeguards

### Anti-Manipulation Measures

1. **Vesting Cliffs**: Prevent immediate dumps from large holders
2. **Staking Lockups**: Reduce liquid supply through validator requirements
3. **Governance Delays**: Time-locked treasury withdrawals
4. **Slashing Penalties**: Discourage malicious validator behavior

### Supply Controls

The network implements several mechanisms to manage token supply:

- **Fee Burning**: 50% of transaction fees burned (deflationary)
- **Treasury Management**: Governance-controlled minting caps
- **Dynamic Rewards**: Adjustment based on network participation
- **Lock Incentives**: Higher rewards for longer staking periods

### Centralization Risks

- No single entity controls >20% at genesis
- Team tokens have longest vesting (4 years)
- Foundation treasury requires governance approval
- Validator set caps prevent concentration

### Market Stability

- Staggered vesting prevents supply shocks
- Fee burning provides deflationary pressure
- Utility demand from identity services
- Cross-chain value capture mechanisms

## Token Utility & Value Accrual

### Primary Utilities

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Network Security">
    Staking for validation and delegation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Governance">
    Voting on protocol upgrades and parameters
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transaction Fees">
    Gas payments for network operations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Identity Services">
    Premium features and API access
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Value Accrual Mechanisms

1. **Fee Burning**: 50% of transaction fees burned (deflationary)
2. **Staking Yield**: 7-15% APR depending on network participation
3. **Identity Revenue**: Enterprise licensing fees distributed to stakers
4. **Cross-chain Value**: IBC transfer fees and bridge operations

### Staking Targets

- **Target staking ratio**: 65%
- **Validator set**: 50-100 active validators
- **Minimum stake**: 1M SNR (0.1% of supply)
- **Delegation minimum**: 1 SNR (accessible to all)
