<Warning>
  Permission revocation takes effect **immediately**. Active sessions using the permission will be terminated.
</Warning>

## Revocation Process

### Immediate Effects
- Permission becomes invalid instantly
- Active operations are interrupted
- Cached permissions are invalidated
- No grace period provided

### What Gets Revoked
- The specific permission identified by `permissionId`
- All derived sub-permissions
- Any delegated permissions from this grant

## Finding Permissions to Revoke

<Tip>
  Query your active permissions before revoking:
  ```bash
  snrd query dwn permissions-request --grantor <your_did>
  ```
</Tip>

## Authorization Requirements

You must be either:
- **Original Grantor**: The entity who created the permission
- **Admin Permission Holder**: Have permission management rights

## Revocation Scenarios

### Security Incident
```bash
# Revoke all permissions for compromised account
snrd tx dwn permissions-revoke --grantee <compromised_did> --all
```

### Project Completion
```bash
# Revoke team access after project ends
snrd tx dwn permissions-revoke --permission-id <team_permission>
```

### Access Audit
```bash
# Revoke unused permissions discovered in audit
snrd tx dwn permissions-revoke --permission-id <unused_permission>
```

<Note>
  Consider notifying affected users before revoking permissions to avoid disruption.
