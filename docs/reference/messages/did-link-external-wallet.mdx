<Note>
  Each wallet can only be linked to one DID. Attempting to link the same wallet
  to multiple DIDs will fail.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Ensure you have control of the wallet before linking. Lost wallet access
  means losing this verification method.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  After linking, you can use your external wallet to sign transactions
  and authenticate operations on behalf of your DID.
