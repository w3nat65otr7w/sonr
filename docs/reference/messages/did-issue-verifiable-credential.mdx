<Note>
  Only DIDs with appropriate verification methods can issue credentials.
  The issuer's reputation affects credential trustworthiness.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Set reasonable expiration dates for credentials that represent
  time-bound claims (e.g., memberships, certifications).
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Issued credentials cannot be modified. To update claims,
  revoke the old credential and issue a new one.
</Warning>
