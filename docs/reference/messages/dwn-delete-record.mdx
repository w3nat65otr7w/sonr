description: Remove records from your personal data vault with optional cascading deletion
og:title: DWN Record Deletion
---

<Warning>
  Record deletion is **permanent** and cannot be undone. Ensure you have backups if needed.
</Warning>

## Deletion Options

### Standard Deletion
- Removes only the specified record
- Child records remain intact
- Preserves hierarchical structure

### Pruned Deletion (`prune: true`)
- Removes the record and all descendants
- Cascades through entire subtree
- Useful for removing complete data structures

## Authorization Requirements

You must have one of the following:
- **Owner**: Be the record author
- **Permission**: Have explicit delete permission
- **Protocol Authority**: Have protocol-level delete rights

<Note>
  The `deletedCount` in the response includes all pruned child records.
</Note>

## Safety Considerations

<Tip>
  Query child records before pruning to understand the impact:
  ```bash
  snrd query dwn records-query --parent-id <record_id>
  ```
</Tip>
