<Info>
  DWN permissions enable secure data sharing with granular access control down to individual records.
</Info>

## Permission Scopes

### Interface-Level
Grant access to entire interfaces:
- **Records**: Read/write any records
- **Protocols**: Configure protocols
- **Permissions**: Delegate permission management

### Method-Level
Restrict to specific operations:
- **Records.Write**: Create/update only
- **Records.Query**: Read-only access
- **Records.Delete**: Deletion rights

### Protocol-Level
Scope to protocol-compliant records:
```json
{
  "protocol": "https://protocols.sonr.io/health/v1",
  "interfaceName": "Records",
  "method": "Query"
}
```

### Record-Level
Grant access to specific records:
```json
{
  "recordId": "record_abc123",
  "method": "Write"
}
```

## Conditional Permissions

<Tip>
  Use conditions to create dynamic access rules that adapt to context.
</Tip>

### Time-Based Conditions
```json
{
  "validFrom": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "validUntil": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "timezone": "UTC"
}
```

### Usage Limits
```json
{
  "maxReads": 100,
  "maxWrites": 10,
  "rateLimit": "10/hour"
}
```

### Custom Rules
```json
{
  "ipWhitelist": ["192.168.1.0/24"],
  "requireMFA": true,
  "allowedActions": ["read", "query"]
}
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Always set expiration times for permissions to limit exposure window.
</Warning>

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary access
2. **Time Limits**: Use `expiresAt` for temporary access
3. **Scope Restriction**: Be specific about what's accessible
4. **Regular Audits**: Review and revoke unused permissions

## Common Use Cases

### Healthcare Data Sharing
- Grant doctor temporary access to medical records
- Scope to specific record types
- Auto-expire after appointment

### Collaborative Apps
- Share project documents with team
- Allow comments but not edits
- Revoke when project ends

### IoT Device Access
- Grant device write-only permission
- Restrict to sensor data protocol
- Rate limit submissions
