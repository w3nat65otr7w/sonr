Our incorporation of embedded light nodes signifies a strategic move towards enhancing network robustness and efficiency. These nodes operate with a reduced resource footprint, ensuring a widespread and seamless network distribution. They form the bedrock of the infrastructure, interfacing directly with a series of validators. These validators are pivotal in maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the network, each playing an instrumental role in processing transactions and securing the network's protocol.

## Blockchain Services

Blockchain Services are instrumental in ensuring seamless interoperability and data exchange across the network.
