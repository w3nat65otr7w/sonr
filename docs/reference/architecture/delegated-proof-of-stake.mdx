title: Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
description: A decentralized, secure, and efficient consensus mechanism.
---

Sonr leverages a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) mechanism to optimize network security and user participation. DPoS imposes an opportunity cost for malicious behavior through slashing, but it also presents challenges that must be addressed for a sustainable design.

## Challenges in Staking Mechanisms

- **Token Value**: The token must have intrinsic value to incentivize staking.
- **Wealth Concentration**: Staking can give an outsized advantage to wealthy users.
- **Coordination Problems**: Staking mechanisms can be gamed by coordinated actors.

## Sonr's Approach to DPoS

We have designed our staking mechanism to address these challenges and create a sustainable and equitable system:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Low Barrier to Entry">
    The upfront capital required to stake is designed to not significantly
    discourage participation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Slashing for Malice">
    If a stakeholder group makes decisions that materially harm the network,
    their stake is slashed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Incentivizing Positive Growth">
    Stakeholders can make decisions that positively impact the future network
    health and token price, promoting long-term growth.
  </Card>
