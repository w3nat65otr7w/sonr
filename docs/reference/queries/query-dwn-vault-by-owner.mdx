description: List secure vaults with optional owner filtering
og:title: DWN Vault Listing
---

<Info>
  Users typically have one primary vault, but may have multiple for different security contexts.
</Info>

## Query Patterns

### List My Vaults
```bash
?owner=did:sonr:alice
```

### List All Vaults (Governance)
```bash
# No filter - requires admin permissions
?pagination.limit=100
```

## Vault Management

<Tip>
  Create separate vaults for different security levels (personal, business, high-security).
</Tip>

### Vault Strategy

#### Primary Vault
- Daily operations
- Standard security
- Regular key rotation

#### High-Security Vault
- Sensitive operations
- Enhanced encryption
- Frequent rotation

#### Archive Vault
- Long-term storage
- Infrequent access
- Extended rotation

## Vault Creation

### Prerequisites
- `vaultCreationEnabled` must be true
- Sufficient gas for creation
- Valid DID or account

### Creation Process
```bash
# Create new vault
snrd tx dwn vault-create --from alice

# Verify creation
snrd query dwn vaults --owner did:sonr:alice
```

<Warning>
  Vault creation may be disabled by governance. Check module parameters first.
</Warning>

## Pagination

### Efficient Queries
```bash
# First page
?owner=did:sonr:alice&pagination.limit=10

# Next page
?owner=did:sonr:alice&pagination.key=<next_key>
```

<Note>
  Most users have 1-3 vaults. Pagination is mainly for system-wide queries.
