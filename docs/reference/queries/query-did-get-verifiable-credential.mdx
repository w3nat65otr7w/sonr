<Info>
  Verifiable credentials are cryptographically signed claims that can
  be independently verified without contacting the issuer.

<Warning>
  Always check the `revoked` field and expiration date before
  accepting a credential as valid.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Verify the issuer's DID to ensure the credential comes from a
  trusted authority in your trust framework.
